title: Joining my lab
feature_text: |
  I always welcome email enquiries from people whose research interests overlap with my own. 
  Previous lab members have gone on to a permanent academic post, to postdoctoral research, and to industry.
  Our group hosts a well-equipped, EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary microscopy laboratory,
  which has given us substantial in-house capabilities for collaborative research at the life sciences interface.

## PhD projects available for an October 2023 start

I am currently recruiting two PhD students for an October 2023 start, in the field of computational microscopy
The projects are suitable for a student with a strong first degree in the physical sciences, a good grounding in optical physics, and an aptitude for computer programming (our preferred language is Python).
If you are a strong student who would be a competitive applicant for the scholarship schemes described further down this page, we can also discuss other possible research topics connected with [my research interests](https://jmtayloruk.github.io/research) - contact me by email to discuss. 

#### Sample-Adaptive Smart Microscopy

3D timelapse microscope imaging of biological samples is revolutionising biology, unlocking the ability to directly witness events such as cell-cell interactions whose location in time and space cannot be predicted in advance. Even more powerful would be the ability for a “smart microscope” to detect and respond to these events in real time without human intervention, for example activating high-resolution imaging in the local area of interest, or applying an external intervention such as photo-ablation targeting of a cell of interest.  The successful PhD candidate will develop an adaptive fluorescence microscopy system capable of observing a live specimen over a wide field of view for extended time periods, but then able to image specific events of interest at subcellular resolution. This hardware will be controlled using existing and newly-developed technologies for cell tracking and event detection in microscopy, to create a smart microscope platform for fully-automated timelapse study of live samples such as zebrafish. This will enable detection and monitoring of events such as immune cell interactions with damaged cells in zebrafish heart muscle, and the ability to selectively modulate these interactions by photo-ablation.
[More details here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/doctor-of-philosophy-phd-sample-adaptive-smart-microscopy-cairn-research-and-university-of-glasgow/?p119252), or contact me for more info.
You will work closely with the industrial partner, including a placement in their own research laboratories, and there is the possibility of additional travel to visit collaborators’ research labs.
This project comes with full funding for UK students. 

#### Advanced computational microscopy for mapping fluid dynamics within the beating heart

Much remains to be understood about the way mechanical and hydrodynamic forces, and electrical signalling, interact to drive heart function and growth. 
This project will develop new optically-based flow imaging techniques to obtain high-precision three-dimensional flow and force measurements in the dynamic environment of the live beating heart.
[More details here](https://phd-admin.findauniversity.com/#/phd/inst/307/dept/567/projects/141257), or contact me for more info. Strong applicants from anywhere worldwide interested in these projects or other topics within my [research interests](/research/)
can potentially be nominated for competitive scholarship funding (contact me urgently - deadline for completed formal application is 31st January at the latest) - see details in next sections below.


#### Environment and funding
Both projects will involve close collaboration with an industrial partner (leading UK microscopy companies) as well as biomedical research collaborators seeking to use our techniques to further their own research studies.
You will experience broad interdisciplinary training, becoming an expert in optical microscopy, instrumentation technology development, 
and also develop a working understanding of the biomedical research applications that are driving our work. 
During the PhD you will be embedded in the Imaging Concepts Group (ICG) at the University of Glasgow, comprised of four academics and 15-20 postdocs, research fellows and PhD students 
all working on related aspects of optical imaging, with a strong focus on biomedical applications including cardiovascular and ocular biomedicine.

## Prospective PhD students

I normally advertise PhD projects on [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com) from around November each year, but if you are interested in a particular research area where I am not advertising a specific project, let's talk about it.
I may have one or more fully-funded projects available in any given year.

There are also various scholarship routes available for a suitably-qualified applicant.
In all these cases, applications must be made via the university, with varying deadlines, so you should contact me well in advance to discuss this: 

- Scottish-resident applicants with a strong first-class degree are eligible for the [Carnegie Trust PhD Scholarship scheme](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/carnegie-phd-scholarships)
Contact me by early December; internal selection early January.
- Black UK-domiciled students can apply for the [James McCune Smith PhD Scholarships](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith); final application deadline 31st January. 
In addition to full funding these provide an enhanced experience through external mentors, placements, leadership training, community-building activities and networking opportunities.
Contact me by early December (guidance available for putting together an application); application deadline end of January.
- Chinese applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the [China Scholarship Council scheme](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/thechinascholarshipcouncil).
Contact me by December; internal selection late January.
- Non-UK applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the College Scholarship scheme. Contact me by December; internal selection late January.

I wrote some general guidance for prospective PhD applicants [here]({% post_url 2021-10-11-phd-applications-applying %}).

## Prospective postdoctoral researchers

I advertise funded postdoctoral vacancies on [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) as and when they become available.

If you want to develop your own research ideas and join my lab, please get in touch to discuss my supporting you with a fellowship application.
We have previously hosted a number of research fellows, including a [Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
and an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow.

## Coming to Scotland

Scotland is a friendly and welcoming country, with Glasgow being located on the beautiful west coast.
Glasgow has a thriving cultural scene, is a great city to be based in for access to the outdoors, and has a very affordable cost of living.
[Hiking](https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/hiking-in-scotland-11-of-the-best-hikes-in-the-country),
[mountain biking](https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/active/mountain-biking), 
[sea kayaking](https://www.wildernessscotland.com/blog/top-10-scottish-sea-kayaking-spots)
and [mountaineering](https://www.ellis-brigham.com/news-and-blogs/25-scottish-winter-classics) are just some of the activities that our group members enjoy.
Scotland's mountains are small by global standards, but are wild and remote, and [liberal land access laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Outdoor_Access_Code) mean you can basically roam and explore anywhere you want!
