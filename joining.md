  ## Joining my lab
  
  I always welcome email enquiries from people whose research interests overlap with my own. 
  Previous lab members have gone on to a permanent academic post, to postdoctoral research, and to industry.

### Prospective PhD students

I normally advertise PhD projects on [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com) from around November each year, but if you are interested in a particular research area where I am not advertising a specific project, let's talk about it.
I may have one or more fully-funded projects available in any given year.

There are also various scholarship routes available for a suitably-qualified applicant.
In all these cases, applications must be made via the university, with varying deadlines, so you should contact me in the first instance to discuss this: 

- Scottish-resident applicants with a strong first-class degree are eligible for the [Carnegie Trust PhD Scholarship scheme](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/carnegie-phd-scholarships)
Contact me by early December; internal selection early January.
- Chinese applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the [China Scholarship Council scheme](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/thechinascholarshipcouncil).
Contact me by December; internal selection late January.
- Non-UK applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the College Scholarship scheme. Contact me by December; internal selection late January.

### Prospective postdoctoral researchers

I advertise funded postdoctoral vacancies on [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) as and when they become available.

If you want to develop your own research ideas and join my lab, please get in touch to discuss my supporting you with a fellowship application.
We have previously hosted a number of research fellows, including a [Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
and an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow.

### Coming to Scotland

Scotland is a friendly and welcoming country, with Glasgow being located on the beautiful west coast.
Glasgow has a thriving cultural scene, and is a great city to be based in for access to the outdoors, with a very affordable cost of living.
[Hiking](https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/hiking-in-scotland-11-of-the-best-hikes-in-the-country),
[mountain biking](https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/active/mountain-biking), 
[sea kayaking](https://www.wildernessscotland.com/blog/top-10-scottish-sea-kayaking-spots)
and [mountaineering](https://www.ellis-brigham.com/news-and-blogs/25-scottish-winter-classics) are just some of the activities that some our group members enjoy.
Scotland's mountains are small by global standards, but are wild and remote, and [liberal land access laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Outdoor_Access_Code) mean you can go basically anywhere you want!
