  ## Joining my lab
  
  I always welcome email enquiries from people whose research interests overlap with my own. 
  Previous lab members have gone on to a permanent academic post, to postdoctoral research, and to industry.
  Our group hosts a well-equipped, EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary microscopy laboratory,
  which has given us substantial in-house capabilities for collaborative research at the life sciences interface.

## PhD projects available for an October 2021 start

I am anticipating funding for two PhD projects for an October 2021 start, in the field of smart microscopy, i.e. combining computational and optical techniques to develop microscopes that can adapt their behaviour based on what is happening inside the sample that is being imaged.
The projects are suitable for a student with a strong first degree in the physical sciences, a good grounding in optical physics, and an aptitude for computer programming (our preferred language is Python).

#### Beating-heart microscopy technologies for biomedical applications

In microscope imaging, the beating of the heart produces dramatic motion that swamps subtle effects in individual cells. This project will develop optical and computational technologies to enable imaging in the heart itself as effectively as if we could “freeze time” and look at a stationary object. Our new technologies will be based on advanced, novel computer algorithms combined with a detailed understanding of how the heart’s precise motion can vary over time. Our group has developed the concept of “prospective optical gating” (see references below) to deal with the constant motion of living samples being imaged. The successful PhD applicant will develop and apply new, more advanced algorithms based around the same target tracking strategies that underpin everything from space debris tracking to the GPS locator in your phone. This will enable us to predict and correct for complex motions such as those due to the combination of breathing and heartbeat, or in diseased hearts where motion is harder to predict.

#### Sample-Adaptive Smart Microscopy

3D timelapse microscope imaging of biological samples is revolutionising biology, unlocking the ability to directly witness events such as cell-cell interactions whose location in time and space cannot be predicted in advance. Even more powerful would be the ability for a “smart microscope” to detect and respond to these events in real time without human intervention, for example activating high-resolution imaging in the local area of interest, or applying an external intervention such as photo-ablation targeting of a cell of interest.  The successful PhD candidate will develop an adaptive fluorescence microscopy system capable of observing a live specimen over a wide field of view for extended time periods, but then able to image specific events of interest at subcellular resolution. This hardware will be controlled using existing and newly-developed technologies for cell tracking and event detection in microscopy, to create a smart microscope platform for fully-automated timelapse study of live samples such as zebrafish. This will enable detection and monitoring of events such as immune cell interactions with damaged cells in zebrafish heart muscle, and the ability to selectively modulate these interactions by photo-ablation.

#### Environment and funding
Both projects will involve close collaboration with an industrial partner (leading UK microscopy companies) as well as biomedical research collaborators seeking to use our techniques to further their own research studies.
You will experience broad interdisciplinary training, becoming an expert in optical microscopy, instrumentation technology development and commercialisation, 
but also developing a working understanding of the biomedical research applications that are driving our work. 
You will work closely with the industrial partner, including a placement in their own research laboratories, and there is the possibility of travel to visit collaborators’ research labs. 
During the PhD you will be embedded in the Imaging Concepts Group (ICG) at the University of Glasgow, comprised of four academics and 15-20 postdocs, research fellows and PhD students 
all working on related aspects of optical imaging, with a strong focus on biomedical applications including cardiovascular and ocular biomedicine.


Both projects are expected to come with full funding for UK and EU students. If you are a strong student from another country interested in these projects or other topics within my [research interests](/research/)
then you should get in touch urgently, as there is the potential for you to be nominated for competitive scholarship funding (deadline for completed formal application is 31st January) - see details in next section below.


## Prospective PhD students

I normally advertise PhD projects on [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com) from around November each year, but if you are interested in a particular research area where I am not advertising a specific project, let's talk about it.
I may have one or more fully-funded projects available in any given year.

There are also various scholarship routes available for a suitably-qualified applicant.
In all these cases, applications must be made via the university, with varying deadlines, so you should contact me in the first instance to discuss this: 

- Scottish-resident applicants with a strong first-class degree are eligible for the [Carnegie Trust PhD Scholarship scheme](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/carnegie-phd-scholarships)
Contact me by early December; internal selection early January.
- Chinese applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the [China Scholarship Council scheme](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/thechinascholarshipcouncil).
Contact me by December; internal selection late January.
- Non-UK applicants with a high-achieving undergraduate GPA are eligible for the College Scholarship scheme. Contact me by December; internal selection late January.

I wrote some general guidance for prospective PhD applicants [here]({% post_url 2021-10-11-phd-applications-applying %})

## Prospective postdoctoral researchers

I advertise funded postdoctoral vacancies on [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) as and when they become available.

If you want to develop your own research ideas and join my lab, please get in touch to discuss my supporting you with a fellowship application.
We have previously hosted a number of research fellows, including a [Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
and an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow.

## Coming to Scotland

Scotland is a friendly and welcoming country, with Glasgow being located on the beautiful west coast.
Glasgow has a thriving cultural scene, and is a great city to be based in for access to the outdoors, with a very affordable cost of living.
[Hiking](https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/hiking-in-scotland-11-of-the-best-hikes-in-the-country),
[mountain biking](https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/active/mountain-biking), 
[sea kayaking](https://www.wildernessscotland.com/blog/top-10-scottish-sea-kayaking-spots)
and [mountaineering](https://www.ellis-brigham.com/news-and-blogs/25-scottish-winter-classics) are just some of the activities that some our group members enjoy.
Scotland's mountains are small by global standards, but are wild and remote, and [liberal land access laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Outdoor_Access_Code) mean you can basically roam and explore anywhere you want!
