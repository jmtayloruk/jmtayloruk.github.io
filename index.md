I am a senior lecturer in Physics at Glasgow University, leading a team of researchers embedded within the wider [Imaging Concepts Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/imagingconcepts/).
The Imaging Concepts Group consists of myself, Prof Andy Harvey and Dr Caroline Muellenbroich. 
My own research team develops novel optical microscopy techniques, with a particular interest in the intersection of light sheet microscopy, computational imaging, and in vivo biology.
I collaborate closely with biological researchers at a number of other universities, including Edinburgh University where I have helped them develop their heartbeat-synchronized light sheet microscope platform.

You can read about my current research interests [here](/research/).
Current and past research funding includes support from EPSRC, the British Heart Foundation, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and BBSRC.
