  ## Technical challenges in realtime microscopy
  
Tuesday 21 June 2022, Glasgow

This one-day workshop will bring together a focused group of people who may be working on quite different applications and biological scenarios, but with a common need to deal with high data-rate imagery and processing, and/or realtime hardware feedback. The workshop is targeted both at people working on the technology side of imaging, and at technologically-literate biologists planning on conducting experiments that will require realtime image-based feedback etc. There is much knowledge and activity in this area distributed around the UK (and beyond), but currently also much “reinvention of the wheel” in individual labs. 
  
The day will be a workshop-style meeting with the aim of sharing of expertise/knowledge for technical problems in realtime microscopy, and conversations over future aspirations, funding sources, networking and seeding of collaborations in realtime microscopy around the UK. Our intention is to have an open, forward-looking environment in which preliminary and aspiring work can be discussed freely.

## Discussion topics for the day include:

1. Closing the loop for for interactive microscopy
- Image-based “intelligent” microscopy, responding to sample activity and movement
- Optogenetic stimulation, laser ablation, adaptive optics, time-gated imaging, etc
- Integrating hardware units with control software

2. Technical challenges in realtime data processing
- Technologies for fast processing and closed-loop realtime control (experiences with GPU, microcontrollers, FPGA, DAQ cards…)
- Handling and processing high data-rate imagery (pushing the limits of computing bandwidth, no-storage strategies with realtime data analysis, etc)

3. Software platforms for smart microscopy
- What software platforms exist to enable customized interactive control of microscope systems?
- Custom smart microscopy integrated with commercial microscope platforms
- How do we avoid reinventing the wheel? Interoperability, modular approaches, open-source and collaborative efforts

4. Getting started: how do I…?
- Problem-solving discussions about technical obstacles and possible routes to solutions.

5. What does the future look like? Challenge scenarios requiring smart microscopy
- Biological applications where new questions could be answered with a “smart” microscope.
- Realtime feedback
- Slower-paced “decisions” in adapting the imaging strategy in response to sample morphology, behaviour, etc
- Where can smart microscopy make the biggest differences in biology?


## Registration - deadline 27 May
[Please register your attendance here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMynu9p_JMXeIE9KfukhRh0b-svsLVUWEp1lhl3wYRWhWX9A/viewform?usp=sf_link), 
providing a short bio and information on topics you especially wish to contribute on.
If the workshop is over-subscribed, we may select attendees on the basis of: relevance of the submitted bios/abstracts, balance of career stages, and diversity.


## Location and logistics
The workshop will take place in Glasgow, hosted at the [House For An Art Lover](https://www.glasgowmackintosh.com/attraction/house-for-an-art-lover) in Bellahouston Park. 
We will start at 10am, which should allow time for anybody wishing to take an early flight up to Glasgow on the day, or for people travelling from within Scotland. The workshop will finish at 5pm.

If you are arriving by public transport, it is a 15 minute walk from Dumbreck railway station or 20 minutes from Ibrox subway stop. 
Free parking is available at the venue, which is just a few minutes off the M8. The venue is a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport or from Glasgow main rail stations.

Lunch, coffee etc will be provided throughout the day. 
We plan to organise an optional evening meal in the west end after the close of the workshop, for those who are able to stay. 
The workshop itself has been kindly sponsored by the IBIN network, so there is no registration fee for the event. 
Delegates will need to cover the cost of the evening meal if they wish to attend that (details to follow).

For those requiring overnight accommodation, there are plenty of accommodation options in the west end of Glasgow. Some possibilities include:
Belhaven Hotel https://www.belhavenhotel.com/
Ambassador Hotel https://glasgowhotelsandapartments.co.uk/home/ambassador-hotel/
Albion Hotel https://glasgowhotelsandapartments.co.uk/home/albion-hotel/
Argyll Hotel http://www.argyllhotelglasgow.co.uk/glasgow-west-end-hotel.htm
